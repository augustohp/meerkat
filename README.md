A similar artists finder sit on top of last.fm.

For this work you will need to change ```config.rb``` and put your own last.fm API key.

Sorry for no tests, I'll work on that later (I know shit about Ruby)...

To make a try type ```rackup -p 4567``` from your command line e check your browser at ```http://localhost:4567```
